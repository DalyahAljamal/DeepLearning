# DeepLearning

In this repository, I will be working on deep learning project to duplicate the experiments' results performed in a research paper entitled
"Hand pose estimation based on deep learning depth map for hand gesture recognition".


The project contains three main stages:
1. Hand Detection
2. Hand Pose Estimation
3. Hand Gesture Recognition
